This scenario enables the creation of HTTP GET requests, by appending parameters to base URLs.
The formed GET requests can be called using [Restroom-mw's http statements](https://dyne.github.io/restroom-mw/#/packages/http), using **curl** or other. 
 


You would load a base url:

[](../_media/examples/zencode_cookbook/http/base-url.json ':include :type=code json')


And then load the parameters: 

[](../_media/examples/zencode_cookbook/http/api-values.json ':include :type=code json')

The basic script to generate the GET looks like this:

[](../_media/examples/zencode_cookbook/http/api-compose.zen ':include :type=code gherkin')


Note that the parameters are added in the order they're appended in the script. The result should look like: 

[](../_media/examples/zencode_cookbook/http/api-compose-output.json ':include :type=code json')


# The script used to create the material in this page

All the smart contracts and the data you see in this page are generated by the script [http.bats](https://github.com/dyne/Zenroom/blob/master/test/zencode/http.bats). If you want to run the script (on Linux) you should: 
 - *git clone https://github.com/dyne/Zenroom.git*
 - install  **jq**
 - download a [zenroom binary](https://zenroom.org/#downloads) and place it */bin* or */usr/bin* or in *./Zenroom/src*
