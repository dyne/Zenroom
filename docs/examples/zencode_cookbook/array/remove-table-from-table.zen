Given I have a 'string array' named 'identities'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'identity'
When I create the size of 'identities'
and I rename 'size' to 'before'
and I remove the 'identity' from 'identities'
and I create the size of 'identities'
and I rename 'size' to 'after'
Then print the 'before'
and print the 'after'
