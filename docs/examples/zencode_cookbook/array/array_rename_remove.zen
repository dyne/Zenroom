rule input encoding url64
rule output encoding hex
Given I have a 'url64 array' named 'bonnetjes'
When I create the random pick from 'bonnetjes'
and I rename the 'random pick' to 'lucky one'
and I remove the 'lucky one' from 'bonnetjes'
# redundant check
and I verify the 'lucky one' is not found in 'bonnetjes'
Then print the 'lucky one'
