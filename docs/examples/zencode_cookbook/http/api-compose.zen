Scenario 'http': create a GET request concatenating values on a HTTP url

# The base URL and the parameters are loaded as strings
Given I have a 'string' named 'base-url'
Given I have a 'string' named 'lon'
Given I have a 'string' named 'lat'
Given I have a 'string' named 'product'
Given I have a 'string' named 'output'

# The statement 'create the url' creates an object to which parameters
# can be appended to create a valid GET request
When I create the url from 'base-url'

# And here are the parameters to be appended to the query
# They are appended as 'key=value&'
When I append 'lon'     as http request to 'url'
When I append 'lat'     as http request to 'url'
When I append 'product' as http request to 'url'
When I append 'output'  as http request to 'url'

Then print the 'url'
