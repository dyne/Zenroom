Scenario ecdh
Given I am known as 'Carl'
When I create the ecdh key
and I copy the 'ecdh' from 'keyring' to 'ecdh before'
and I create the ecdh public key
and I copy the 'ecdh' from 'keyring' to 'ecdh after'
and I verify 'ecdh before' is equal to 'ecdh after'
Then print 'ecdh before' as 'hex'
and print 'ecdh after' as 'hex'
