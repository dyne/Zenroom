Scenario credential
Scenario petition: sign petition
    Given I am 'Participant_10'
    Given I have my valid 'keyring'
    Given I have my 'credentials'
    Given I have a valid 'issuer public key' inside 'The Authority'
    When I aggregate all the issuer public keys
	When I create the petition signature 'More privacy for all!'
    Then print the 'petition signature'
    # and print the 'issuer public key'
