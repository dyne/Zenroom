Scenario reflow
Given I have a 'reflow public key dictionary' named 'public keys'
and I have a 'string dictionary' named 'Sale'
When I aggregate the reflow public key from array 'public keys'
and I create the reflow identity of 'Sale'
and I create the reflow seal with identity 'reflow identity'
Then print the 'reflow seal'
