Scenario 'reflow' : Verify the identity in the seal 
Given I have a 'reflow seal'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'Sale'
When I create the reflow identity of 'Sale'
When I rename the 'reflow identity' to 'SaleIdentity'
When I verify 'SaleIdentity' is equal to 'identity' in 'reflow seal'
Then print the string 'The reflow identity in the seal is verified'
