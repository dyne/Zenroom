Scenario reflow
Given I have a 'reflow seal'
and I have a 'issuer public key' in 'The Authority'
and I have a 'reflow signature'
When I aggregate all the issuer public keys
and I verify the reflow signature credential
and I verify the reflow signature fingerprint is new
and I add the reflow fingerprint to the reflow seal
and I add the reflow signature to the reflow seal
Then print the 'reflow seal'
