Given I have the 'keyring'
and I have a 'satoshi amount'
and I have a 'satoshi fee'
and I have a 'testnet address'
and I have a 'testnet unspent'

When I create the testnet transaction to 'testnet address'
and I sign the testnet transaction
and I create the testnet raw transaction
Then print the 'testnet raw transaction' as 'hex'
and print the 'keyring'
