Scenario eddsa
Given I am known as 'Carl'
When I create the eddsa key
and I copy the 'eddsa' from 'keyring' to 'eddsa before'
and I create the eddsa public key
and I copy the 'eddsa' from 'keyring' to 'eddsa after'
and I verify 'eddsa before' is equal to 'eddsa after'
Then print 'eddsa before' as 'hex'
and print 'eddsa after' as 'hex'
