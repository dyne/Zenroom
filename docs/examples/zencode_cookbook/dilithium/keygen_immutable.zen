Scenario qp
Given I am known as 'Carl'
When I create the dilithium key
and I copy the 'dilithium' from 'keyring' to 'dilithium before'
and I create the dilithium public key
and I copy the 'dilithium' from 'keyring' to 'dilithium after'
and I verify 'dilithium before' is equal to 'dilithium after'
Then print 'dilithium before' as 'hex'
and print 'dilithium after' as 'hex'
