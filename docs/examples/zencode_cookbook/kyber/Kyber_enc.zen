Scenario qp : Bob create the kyber secret for Alice

# Here I declare my identity
Given I am 'Bob'
# Here I load the receiver public key
# that will be needed to create the ciphertext
and I have a 'kyber public key' from 'Alice'

# Here we create the KEM (key encapsulation mechanism)
# The kem contains the 'kyber_cyphertext' that will be sent to other party
# and the 'kyber_secret' which is random number of a defined length
# the 'kyber_secret' needs to be stored separately
When I create the kyber kem for 'Alice'


Then print the 'kyber ciphertext' from 'kyber kem'
Then print the 'kyber secret' from 'kyber kem'
