Given I have a 'base32' named 'my_b32'
Given I have a 'hex' named 'my_hex'
Given I have a 'base64' named 'my_base64'

When I copy 'my_b32' as 'base64' to 'dest_b32'  
When I copy 'my_hex' as 'base32' to 'dest_hex' 
When I copy 'my_base64' as 'base32' to 'dest_b64'   

Then print 'dest b32'
Then print 'dest b64'
Then print 'dest hex'
