Scenario eddsa
Given I have a 'string' named 'hex_path'
and I have a 'string' named 'base58_path'
and I have a 'string' named 'base64_path'
and I have a 'eddsa public key'
When I append the 'hex' of 'eddsa_public_key' to 'hex_path'
and I append the 'base58' of 'eddsa_public_key' to 'base58_path'
and I append the 'base64' of 'eddsa_public_key' to 'base64_path'
Then print the 'hex_path'
and print the 'base58 path'
and print the 'base64 path'
