Given I  have a 'string' named 'str'
and I have a 'integer'
and I have a 'float'
and I have a 'string dictionary' named 'dict'
and I have a 'string array' named 'array'

When I verify 'str' is found
and I verify 'integer' is found
and I verify 'float' is found
and I verify 'dict' is found
and I verify 'array' is found

Then print the string 'found everything'
