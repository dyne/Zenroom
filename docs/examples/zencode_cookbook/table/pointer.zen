Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'dataFromEndpoint'
and I have a 'string' named 'key_inside_list'

When I set pointer to 'dataFromEndpoint'
and I enter 'list' with pointer
and I enter '1' with pointer
and I enter 'key_inside_list' with pointer
and I move 'key_inside_list' in 'pointer'

Then print 'pointer'
and print 'dataFromEndpoint'
