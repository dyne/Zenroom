Scenario ecdh: dictionary computation and signing 

# LOAD DICTIONARIES
# Here we load the two dictionaries and import their data.
# Later we also load some numbers, one of them name "PricePerKG" exists in the dictionary's root, 
# as well as inside each element of the object: homonimy is not a problem in this case.

# FIND MAX and MIN values in Dictionaries
# All the dictionaries contain an internet date 'number' named 'timestamp' 
# In this statement we find the most recent transaction in the dictionary "TransactionsBatchA" 
# by finding the element that contains the number 'timestamp' with the highest value in that dictionary.
# We also save the value of this 'timestamp' in an object that we call "Theta"

and I rename the 'sum value' to 'sumOfTransactionsValueFirstBatch'

# Here we compute the sum of the "TransactionValue" numbers,

# This could be useful when searching for a certain transaction in different data sets
# We are loading the string to match from the dataset.
#When I verify the 'dictionaryToBeFound' is found in 'TransactionsBatchA'
#When I verify the 'dictionaryToBeFound' is found in 'TransactionsBatchA'

and I verify the 'not.there' is not found in 'TransactionsBatchA'

# the values we want to move are all numbers
When I create the 'number dictionary'

And I rename the 'copy' to 'copyOfInformationBatchA'

# that we immediately rename.
# The operators allowed are: +, -, *, /, %.
