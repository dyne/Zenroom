# HASH

# Output objects: as overwriting variables is discouraged in Zenroom, all the hashing
# and cryptography statements will output a new object with a hardcoded name, listed
# along with the statement. It's a good practice to rename the object immediately after
# its creation, both to make it more readable and as well to avoid overwriting in case you
# are using a statement with similar output more than once in the same script.

# The "create hash" statement hashes a string, but it does not hash an array!
# The default algorythm for the hash can be modified by passing them to Zenroom as config file. 
# Note that the object produced, containing the hashing of the string, will be named "hash", 
# which we promptly rename. The same is true for the two following statements.
When I create the hash of 'myFifthString'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOfMyFifthString'

# In the same fashion, we can hash arrays 
When I create the hash of 'myFirstArray'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOf:MyFirstArray'

# or we can hash every element in the array
When I create the hashes of each object in 'myFirstArray'
And I rename the 'hashes' to 'hashOf:ObjectsInMyFirstArray'

# and we can as well hash dictionaries
When I create the hash of 'ABC-Transactions1Data'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOfDictionary:ABC-Transactions1Data'

# Following is a version of the statement above that takes the hashing algorythm as parameter, 
# it accepts sha256 or sha512 as hash types
When I create the hash of 'mySixthString' using 'sha256'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOfMySixthString'
When I create the hash of 'mySeventhString' using 'sha512'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOfMySeventhString'

# Again, you can hash with sha256 or sha512 also arrays and dictionaries
When I create the hash of 'myFirstArray' using 'sha512'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'sha512HashOf:MyFirstArray'

When I create the hash of 'ABC-Transactions1Data' using 'sha512'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'sha512HashOfDictionary:ABC-Transactions1Data'

# Key derivation function (KDF)
# The output object is named "key_derivation":
When I create the key derivation of 'myEleventhStringToBeHashed'
And I rename the 'key_derivation' to 'kdfOfMyEleventhString'

# Password-Based Key Derivation Function (pbKDF) hashing, 
# this also outputs an object named "key_derivation":
When I create the key derivation of 'myTwelfthStringToBeHashedUsingPBKDF2' with password 'myThirteenStringPassword'
And I rename the 'key_derivation' to 'pbkdf2OfmyTwelfthString'

# Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC)
When I create the HMAC of 'myFourteenthStringToBeHashedUsingHMAC' with key 'myThirteenStringPassword'
And I rename the 'HMAC' to 'hmacOfMyFourteenthString'

# AGGREGATE
# The "create the aggregation" statement takes as input an array of numers
# and sums then it into a new object called "aggregation" that we'll rename immediately.
# It works on both arrays and dictionaries, the data type needs to be 
# specified as in the example.
When I create the aggregation of array 'aArray'
And I rename the 'aggregation' to 'aggregationOfMyFirstNumberArray'

# Now let's print out everything
Then print all data
