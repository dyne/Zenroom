# CREATE RANDOM
# The "create random" creates a random object with a default set of parameters
# The name of the generate objected is defined between the ' '  
# The parameters can be modified by passing them to Zenroom as configuration file
When I create the random 'newRandomObject'

# Below is a variation that lets you create a random elements of configurable length.
# This statement doesn't let you choose the name of the name of the newly created element,
# which is hardcoded to "random". We are immediately renaming it.
When I create the random of '128' bits
and I rename the 'random' to 'my128BitsRandom'
When I create the random of '16' bytes
and I rename the 'random' to 'my16BytesRandom'

# The "create random array with" statement, lets you create an array of random elements, 
# and you can select the length in bits or bytes. The first statement uses the default lenght of 512 bits.
# Like the previous one, this statement outputs an object whose name is hardcoded into "array".
# Since we're creating three arrays called "array" below, Zenroom would throw an error because by
# design Zenroom does not allow you to implicity overwrite, so we are renaming the output immediately. 
When I create the random array with '4' elements
and I rename the 'random array' to 'my4RandomArray'
When I create the random array with '5' elements each of '256' bits
and I rename the 'random array' to 'my256BitsRandomArray'
When I create the random array with '6' elements each of '16' bytes
and I rename the 'random array' to 'my16BytesRandomArray'

# You can generate an array of random numbers, from 0 o 65355, with this statement.
When I create the random array with '10' numbers 
and I rename the 'random array' to 'my10RandomNumbersArray'
# A variation of the statement above, allows you to use the "modulo" function to cap the max value
# of the random numbers. In the example below, the max value will be "999".
When I create the random array with '16' numbers modulo '1000'
and I rename the 'random array' to 'my16RandomNumbersModulo1000Array'

# SET
# The 'set' statement creates a new variable and assign it a value.
# Overwriting variables discouraged in Zenroom: if you try to overwrite an existing variable, 
# you will get an error, that you can override the error using a rule 
# in the beginning of the script.
# The 'set' statement can generate different kind of schemas, as well as to create variables 
# containing numbers in different bases. 
# When working with strings, remember that spaces are converted to underscores.
When I set 'myNewlyCreatedString' to 'call me The Pink Panther!' as 'string'
When I set 'myNewlyCreatedBase64' to 'SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh' as 'base64'
When I set 'myNewlytCreatedNumber' to '42' as 'number'
When I set 'myNewlyCreatedNumberInBaseSomething' to '42' base '16'

# CREATE KEYRING
# Keys inside keyrings can be created from a random seed or from a known seed

# Below is the standard keyring generation statement, which uses a random seed
# The random seed can in fact be passed to Zenroom and last for the whole 
# smart contract execution session, via the "config" parameter. 
# Note that, in order to create a keyring, you'll need to declare the identity of the script
# executor, which is done in the Given phase

# Note: we're renaming the created keyrings exclusively cause we're generating 2 keyringss 
# in the same script, so the second would overwrite the first. In reality you never want to 
# rename a keyring, as its schema is hardcoded in Zenroom and cryptographically it doesn't make sense
# to use more than one keyring in the same script.
When I rename the 'keyring' to 'GivenKeyring'
When I create the ecdh key
and I rename the 'keyring' to 'keyringFromRandom'

# Below is a statement to create a keyring from a known seed.
# The seed has to be passed to Zenroom via a string, that can have an arbitrary size
When I create the ecdh key with secret 'myThirteenStringPassword'
and I rename the 'keyring' to 'keyringFromSeed'

Then print all data
