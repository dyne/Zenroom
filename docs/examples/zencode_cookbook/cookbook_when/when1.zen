# WRITE IN (create string or number)
# the "write in" statement create a new object, assigns it an encoding but 
# only "number" or "string" (if you need any other encoding, 
# use the "set as" statement) and assigns it the value you define.
When I write number '10' in 'nameOfFirstNewVariable'
When I write string 'This is my lovely new string!' in 'nameOfSecondNewVariable'


# SUM, SUBTRACTION
# You can use the statement 'When I create the result of ... " to 
# sum, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo with values, see the examples below. The output of the 
# statement will be an object named "result" that we immediately rename.
# The operators allowed are: +, -, *, /, %.
When I create the result of 'b' + 'myThirdNumber'
and I rename the 'result' to 'resultOfmyFirstSum'
When I create the result of 'b' - 'myThirdNumber'
and I rename the 'result' to 'resultOfmyFirstSubtraction'
When I create the result of 'b' * 'myThirdNumber'
and I rename the 'result' to 'resultOfmyFirstMultiplication'
When I create the result of 'b' / 'myThirdNumber'
and I rename the 'result' to 'resultOfmyFirstDivision'
When I create the result of 'b' % 'myThirdNumber'
and I rename the 'result' to 'resultOfmyFirstModulo'

# Now let's do some math with the number that we just created: 

When I create the result of 'b' + 'nameOfFirstNewVariable'
and I rename the 'result' to 'resultOfmySecondSum'
When I create the result of 'b' * 'nameOfFirstNewVariable'
and I rename the 'result' to 'resultOfmySecondMultiplication'

# INVERT SIGN
# you can invert the sign of a number using this statement
# in this example, we create an inverted version of 'a' 
# that goes from '1.2345' to '-1.2345'
When I create the result of 'a' inverted sign
and I rename the 'result' to 'aInvertedSign'


# APPEND
# The "append" statement are pretty self-explaining: 
# append a simple object of any encoding to another one
When I append 'mySecondString' to 'myFifteenthString' 
When I append 'b' to 'myThirdNumber' 

# RENAME
# The "rename" statement: we've been hinting at this for a while now,
# pretty self-explaining, it works with any object type or schema.
When I rename the 'myThirdArray' to 'myJustRenamedArray'

# DELETE
# You can delete an object from the memory stack at runtime
# this is useful if, for example, you have copied an object to perform an operation
# and you don't need the copy anymore
When I delete 'myFourthNumber'

# COPY
# You can copy a an object into a new one
# it works for simple objects (number, string, etc) or complex
# ones (arrays, dictionaries, schemes)
When I copy 'mySixteenthString' to 'copyOfMySixteenthString'
When I copy 'myFirstArray' to 'copyOfMyFirstArray'

# You can copy a certain element from an array, to a new object named "copy", with the
# same encoding of the array, in the root level of the data. 
# We are immeediately renaming the outout for your convenience.
When I copy '3' from 'myFourthArray' to 'copyOfElement3OfmyFourthArray'

# SPLIT (leftmost, rightmost)
# The "split" statements, take as input the name of a string and a numeric value,
# the statement removes the leftmost/outmost characters from the string 
# and places the result in a newly created string called "leftmost" or "rightmost"
# which we immediately rename
When I split the leftmost '4' bytes of 'mySecondString'
And I rename the 'leftmost' to 'myFirstStringLeftmost'
When I split the rightmost '6' bytes of 'myThirdString'
And I rename the 'rightmost' to 'myThirdStringRightmost'

# RANDOMIZE
# The "randomize" statements takes the name of an array as input and shuffles it. 
When I randomize the 'myFourthArray' array


# PICK RANDOM
# The "create a random pick from" picks randomly an element from the target array
# and puts into a newly created variable named "random_pick".
# The name is hardcoded, the object can be renamed.
When I create random pick from 'myFirstArray'
and I rename the 'random_pick' to 'myRandomlyPickedObject'

# PICK MULTIPLE RANDOM ELEMENTS
# If you need several objects from a table, you can use this statement
# it will create a new table (array if source was an array, or dictionary otherwise)
# with the defined amount of objects picked from the original table
When I create random array with 'b' elements from 'myOnlyEcpArray'
and I rename the 'random_array' to 'myNewlyCreatedRandomArray'

# CREATE FLAT ARRAY
# The "flat array" statement, take as input the name of an array or a dictionary,
# the statement flat the input contents or the input keys
# and places the result in a newly created array called "flat array"
When I create the flat array of contents in 'myNestedArray'
and I rename the 'flat array' to 'myFlatArray'
When I create the flat array of contents in 'myNestedDictionary'
and I rename the 'flat array' to 'myFlatDictionaryContents'
When I create the flat array of keys in 'myNestedDictionary'
and I rename the 'flat array' to 'myFlatDictionaryKeys'

Then print all data
