scenario 'dp3t'
rule check version 1.0.0
rule input encoding hex
rule output encoding hex
Given I have an 'hex array' named 'list of infected'
When I create the random pick from 'list of infected'
and I rename the 'random pick' to 'secret day key'
and I write number '180' in 'epoch'
and I write string 'Broadcast key' in 'broadcast key'
and I create the ephemeral ids for today
# and the 'secret day key' is found in 'list of infected'
Then print the 'ephemeral ids'
