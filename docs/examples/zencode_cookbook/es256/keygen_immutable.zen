Scenario es256
Given I am known as 'Carl'
When I create the es256 key
and I copy the 'es256' from 'keyring' to 'es256 before'
and I create the es256 public key
and I copy the 'es256' from 'keyring' to 'es256 after'
and I verify 'es256 before' is equal to 'es256 after'
Then print 'es256 before' as 'hex'
and print 'es256 after' as 'hex'
