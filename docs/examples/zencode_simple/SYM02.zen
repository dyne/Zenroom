Scenario simple: Encrypt a message with the password
Given nothing
# only inline input, no KEYS or DATA passed
When I write string 'my secret word' in 'password'
and I write string 'a very short but very confidential message' in 'whisper'
and I write string 'for your eyes only' in 'header'
# header is implicitly used when encrypt
and I encrypt the secret message 'whisper' with 'password'
# anything introduced by 'the' becomes a new variable
Then print the 'secret message'
