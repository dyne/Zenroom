Scenario coconut: aggregate petition signature
    Given that I have a valid 'petition signature'
    and I have a valid 'petition'
    and I have a valid 'verifiers'
    When the petition signature is not a duplicate
    and the petition signature is just one more
    and I add the signature to the petition
    Then print the 'petition'
    and print the 'verifiers'
