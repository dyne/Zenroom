# Zenroom crypto VM

[![Zenroom logo](docs/_media/images/zenroom_logotype.png)](https://zenroom.org)

Zenroom is a **secure language interpreter** of the domain-specific Zencode, making it easy to execute fast cryptographic operations on any data structure.

The Zenroom VM is very small, has **no external dependency**, is fully deterministic and is ready to run **end-to-end encryption** on any platform: desktop, embedded mobile, cloud micro-services, and web browsers. Zenroom works inside applications written in Javascript, Python3, Rust or Golang.

Zencode has a **no-code** approach. It is a domain-specific language (DSL) **similar to human language**. One can process large data structures through complex cryptographic and logical transformations.

Zencode helps developers to **empower people** who know what to do with data: one can write and review business logic and data-sensitive operations **without learning to code**.

This software has zero dependencies. If you chose to use it in your
project be assured that we intend to support the same code to still
run in 20 years from now on any target platform.

## Getting Started

To quickly try out Zenroom using the Zencode language with some
examples navigate to [ApiRoom](https://apiroom.net) and start typing
into the browser.

The Zenroom VM runs locally in your browser (needs WASM) and
[ApiRoom](https://apiroom.net) provides various examples to show
operational crypto flows.

[ApiRoom](https://apiroom.net) is also an IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) and by signing in with a username and password you can
save your contracts and download them as a Dockerfile micro-service
ready to deploy.
