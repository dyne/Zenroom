Scenario coconut: approve petition
    Given that I have a valid 'verifier' from 'MadHatter'
    and I have a valid 'credential proof'
    and I have a valid 'petition'
    When I aggregate the verifiers
    and I verify the credential proof
    and I verify the new petition to be empty
    Then print the 'petition'
    and print the 'verifiers'
